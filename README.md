# Technical Plans

## Abstract

Wasabi Wallet is the state of the art privacy focused Bitcoin wallet that is based on the [ZeroLink Wallet Fungibility Framework](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/). While mathematically proven privacy can be achieved today with it, the cost, convenience, intuitiveness and strength of this privacy can be greatly improved. This document aims to outline a starting plan to progress towards those objectives.
