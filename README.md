# Technical Plans

## Abstract

Wasabi Wallet is the state of the art privacy focused Bitcoin wallet that is based on the [ZeroLink Wallet Fungibility Framework](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/). While mathematically proven privacy can be achieved today with it, the cost, convenience, intuitiveness and strength of this privacy can be greatly improved. Wasabi also needs to improve its accessibility and its general Bitcoin wallet features. Furtheremore Wasabi should look into ways of extending the scope of its privacy protection to other, not closely Bitcoin related fields, like end to end encrypted messaging. Finally, Wasabi also needs to concentrate on its stability, performance, UX and code quality. This document aims to outline a starting plan to progress towards those objectives.
